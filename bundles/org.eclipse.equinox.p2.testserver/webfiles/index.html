<h1>Welcome to the p2 test server</h1>
<p>You can access all files under the "webfiles" folder in this bundle via either a "public" or "private"
pseudoroot. Try the public link <a href="http://localhost:8080/public/index.html">here</a></p>
<p>To access using a login, password, you simply use the pseudoroot "/private", and you will be asked to
log in. The credentials are: user: <b>Aladdin</b>, password: <b>open sesame</b>. Try it
<a href="http://localhost:8080/private/index.html">here</a></p>
