/**
 * Stores files by copying them to a uniquely named temporary directory.
 * The BackupStore remembers filenames and can recreate them in their original location.
 * 
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 * The user of this class should instantiate the BackupStore with some prefix that is 
 * meaningful to a human. Uniqueness is obtained without the prefix - the prefix is used to 
 * be able to differentiate between different backup directories by a human (in case of crashes etc).
 * 
 * If instantiated with a directory this directory will be used to store the backup root directory. If
 * this directory is null, the users home directory is used by default.
 * 
 * Once instantiated, use the {@link #backup(File)} and {@link #backupDirectory(File)} methods
 * to move files to backup instead of deleting them. A file that
 * is backed up should not be deleted - it is simply moved out of the way. 
 * Use {@link #backupCopy(File)} to
 * move the file out of harms way, but keep a copy of it in the original location.
 * The methods {@link #backupAll(File)} and {@link #backupCopyAll(File)} backs up an entire structure.
 * 
 * When backup is finished - the user should either call {@link #restore()} to put all 
 * of the files back, or call {@link #discard()} to remove all of the backed up "copies".
 * 
 * If {@link #restore()} or {@link #discard()} is not called the backup files will never be deleted.
 * 
 * The backup store does not synchronize directories - actions that write new files are
 * responsible for removing them. Overwriting existing files should be done by first backing
 * up the file, and then creating a new file. Modifying a file, should be done by 
 * using {@link #backupCopy(File)} or 
 * first making a copy, then backing up the original, and then renaming the copy.
 *  
 * <h3>Read Only and Permissions</h3>
 * Directories that are read only (to current user) can not be backed up.
 * Backup is performed using {@link File#renameTo(File)} and handling of permissions
 * is operating system dependent. It is expected that a Un*x type system retains the
 * permissions as a file is moved to the backup store and later gets restored.
 * Backup directories are created as they are needed and will (at least on Un*x) inherit the
 * permissions from its parent directory. 
 * 
 * If a rename can not be performed, the backup store will make a copy and delete the original
 * file. This makes it possible to backup and restore across volume boundaries.
 * 
 * When restoring directories they
 * will be created with permissions in a platform specific way (on UN*IX they will inherit the permissions 
 * of the parent directory).
 * 
 * <h3>Checkpointing</h3> 
 * Checkpointing (i.e. to be able to rollback to a particular point) can be implemented by using
 * multiple instances of BackupStore. The client code will need to remember the individual order
 * among the backup stores.
 * 
 * <h3>Restartability</h3>
 * Not implemented - it is possible to obtain the name of the backup directories,
 * so manual restore is possible after a crash. An idea is to add persistence to a file, and
 * be able to read it back in again.
 * 
 * <h3>A note about exceptions</h3>
 * In general {@link IllegalArgumentException} is thrown when attempting an operation
 * that is considered "wrong use", and an {@link IllegalStateException} or subclass thereof is thrown on an overall
 * wrong use of BackupStore (i.e. attempt to backup when store has been restored). Some cases of
 * "wrong use" can not be differentiated from I/O errors (like a "file not found" as this could
 * be caused by an entire disk disappearing - in these case an {@link IOException} is thrown.
 * 
 * <h3>Implementation Note</h3>
 * The backup root directory will contain folders that reflects file system roots. These are encoded using 
 * "_" for the UNI*X root directory, "__" for a Windows network mounted directory, and single "drive letter" folders
 * corresponding to Windows drive letters. Typically, on UN*X there will only be a "_" directory in the backup root,
 * and on windows there will typically be a single directory called "C".
 *
